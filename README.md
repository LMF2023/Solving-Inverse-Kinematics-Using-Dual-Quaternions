# Solving-Inverse-Kinematics-Using-Dual-Quaternions
This code solves the inverse kinematics of an SSRMS-type configuration manipulator using dual quaternions, given the angle value of joint 2.
It should be noted that the code does not specify concrete joint parameters for the manipulator. However, the author believes this code is applicable to any parameters that satisfy the configuration requirements of the manipulator.
